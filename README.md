Objective:4bit fulladder

Verilog module defines a FULLADDER with inputs a,b, cin where a, b are 4bit binary inputs and ouputs are sum and cout. Here sum is the 4 bit binary output.
The outputs sum and cout are reg datatypes because the outputs continuously changes as the any one of the input changes.
The code was implemented using behavioral modelling using always statement which repeats continuously throughout the duration of simulation time and starts at 0 simulation time.
The OR operation has been used and the outputs sum and cout are concatenated using concatenation operator(,). 
In TESTBENCH the dumpfile and dumpvars are used to obatain the wvaeform. and $monitor is used to print the outputs as the input chnages.
